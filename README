Hi. This is a standard readme file, providing some general information about OpenTickets, some basic instructions of the several ways to install OpenTickets, a few thoughts from the developer, and possibly a changelog, once future versions become available.

    INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

These instructions are pretty universal, standard methods employed when you install any plugin. If you have ever installed one for your WordPress installation, you can probably skip this part.

The below instructions assume that you have:
1. Downloaded the OpenTickets software from WordPress.org
2. Have either some basic knowledge of the WordPress admin screen or some basic ftp and ssh knowledge,
3. The ability to follow an outlined list of instructions. ;-)

Via the WordPress Admin:
1. Login to the admin dashboard of your WordPress site.
2. Click the 'Plugins' menu item on the left sidebar, usually found somewhere near the bottom.
3. Near the top left of the loaded page, you will see an Icon, the word 'Plugins', and a button next to those, labeled 'Add New'. Click 'Add New'.
4. In the top left of this page, you will see another Icon and the words 'Install Plugins'. Directly below that are a few links, one of which is 'Upload'. Click 'Upload'.
5. On the loaded screen, below the links described in STEP #4, you will see a location to upload a file. Click the button to select the file you downloaded from http://WordPress.org/.
6. Once the file has been selected, click the 'Install Now' button.
6.a. Depending on your server setup, you may need to enter some FTP credentials, which you should have handy.
7. If all goes well, you will see a link that reads 'Activate Plugin'. Click it.
8. Once you see the 'Activated' confirmation, you will see new icons in the menu.
9. Start using OpenTickets.

Via SSH:
1. FTP the file you downloaded from http://WordPress.org/ to your server. (We assume you know how to do this)
2. Login to your server via ssh. (.... you know this too).
3. Issue the command 'cd /path/to/your/website/installation/wp-content/plugins/', where /path/to/your/website/installation/wp-content/plugins/ is the plugins directory on your site.
4. 'cp /path/to/opentickets.zip .', to copy the downloaded file to your plugins directory.
5. 'unzip opentickets.zip', to unzip the downloaded file, creating an opentickets directory inside your plugins directory.
6. Open a browser, and follow steps 1-2 under 'Via the WordPress Admin' above, to get to your 'plugins' page.
7. Find OpenTickets on your plugins list, click 'Activate' which is located directly below the name of the plugin.
8. Start using OpenTickets


    DEVELOPER THOUGHTS

This software is designed with the idea that there are several components that make up an event, all of which have a specific association to the next, and all of which work together to define the finished product.

First you need a 'Venue', which in general terms, is just a location that has areas which can be used to host events. A good example of a Venue would be a Hotel. Hotels, generally speaking, have multiple conference rooms available for rental. Ergo, on any given day, during any given time, any number of these several conference rooms could be occupied with a different event.

Next you need an 'Event Area'. In general, an event area is meant to represent a sub-location of the Venue; for instance, a conference room inside the aforementioned Hotel. Each room may have it's own configurations of seats, it's own stage position, it's own entrances and exits, and it's own pricing. There are scenarios in which this does not entirely hold up as an example, but in general, try to think of it this way.

With this information, we can now piece together an event. An event is hosted by a 'Venue' and has pricing and a layout designated in the 'Event Area'.

Hopefully this clears up some general concepts about the idea behind the software.
